## Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy


### Hands on
Construct a hole-less polymer cell like we did for [Measuring reaction-less ionic conductivity](#Measuring-reaction-less-ionic-conductivity). Perform EIS at third floor lab.

We expct the spectra to be characteristic of a [debye circuit](https://lithiuminventory.com/experimental-electrochemistry/eis/debye-circuit/) and can compare our results directly with [HMIMTFSI | Celgard membrane](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adfm.202306633), as well as our LCR meter results. 

**Status: sanity check our data!**

### EIS for La2/3TiO3

Theory to discuss with Joan:
- Non-blocking electrodes show up as a perfect [RC circuit](https://lithiuminventory.com/experimental-electrochemistry/eis/rc-circuits/).
- Blocking electrodes show up as a [Randles circuit](https://lithiuminventory.com/experimental-electrochemistry/eis/randles-circuit/).

### EIS for LiTaO3

Contingencies:

Cold solder padded bare substrate onto puck as control. Then we're ready to perform EIS.


Give Brian a tutorial on all the EIS stuff.
Be prepared to discuss anisotropy. 

**Status: withold Brian discussion till after results; next wire to PCB, our modified puck.**





## Nature of HMIM-TFSI
O organic chemist Yibing, please grant us one question: 
> Among the [acidic ionic liquids](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00763#:~:text=An%20acidic%20ionic%20liquid%20can,cation%2C%20anion%2C%20or%20both.), does HMIM-TFSI bear any characteristic of a Lewis acid or a Bronsted acid?

![截屏2024-06-24 上午11.04.23](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJirSVvU0.png)


- ~~Lewis acid~~ : a substance that accepts electron pairs.
   -  Electron acceptor capacity：usually located in the anion
     - Why anion
         - Cations in Lewis acidic ionic liquids are usually **designed** to have relatively high stability to avoid side reactions. Cations designed in this way keep the entire ionic liquid system stable, while anions are more likely to adjust their electronic structure to accept electron pairs.
         - Imidazole cations (e.g., HMIM⁺) typically have a full π-electron system and high resonance stability and are less likely to accept additional electron pairs.
   - Charge & Electron Density
     -  Overall charge : the total amount of electric charge in a molecule or ion
     -  Local electron density : the distribution of electrons in specific regions within a molecule or ion
     -  Although an anion carries a net negative charge, certain regions within itcan exhibit characteristics of electron deficiency, thereby displaying Lewis acidity.
     
   -  TFSI : The electronegative atoms (F O) are highly saturated and stable, and they do not readily accept additional electron pairs. 
  
- ~~Brønsted acid~~: a substance that releases protons (H+)
   - HMIM：the H on the imidazole ring are not attached to atoms with high electronegativity (e.g., O N S)C-H is not so acidic.
   - TFSI: no H
- Ionic Conductivity of HMIM TFSI
   - HMIM: 
       - Conjugation effect: the phenomenon of π-electron delocalisation in molecules (Significant in imidazole cations)
       - Conjugated system → more stable charge distribution → reduces internal electron rearrangements during the movement of the cation → smoother movement.
    - TFSI：
        - Low polarity: polar groups are evenly distributed
        - lower polarity →  lower interaction forces between HMIM and TFSI → ions to move more freely → increasing the ionic conductivity.
## Gating on $H^+$




## Detecting water electrolysis in ionic liquid 

- [x] **Go through cyclic voltammetry with Joan.**

We still have a lot to learn from round-robin studies of HMIM-TFSI:
- [Part 1: experimental methods and results](https://www.nist.gov/publications/thermodynamic-and-thermophysical-properties-reference-ionic-liquid-1-hexyl-3)
    - track changes in $w(H_2O)$ throughout various experiments
- [Part 2: critical evaluation](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1351/PAC-REP-08-09-22/html?_llca=transfer%3A7772f5cf4e88d21caa9740949ee6e50d&_llch=be54cf61ae786d68bd48b5cc5bc50f30fd1c69baf8f171dbff7ac4594b409b46)
    - note results on electrolytic conductivity vs water mole fraction
    - pursue references on the measurement of electrolytic conductivity: how were the experiments set up?


#### Two experiments
Set sweep on Keithley: Linear dual sweep, start 0V, stop 2V, 200 points per cycle, 1 cycle.

Drop PCB in tall flask and immerse in HMIM-TFSI up to src-drn contact pads. First use exposed PCB electrodes as-is. Expect a peak in current at copper (0.34V) or aluminium (-1.66V): this would tell us the composition of the pads. Maybe we'll see a peak around 1.23V due to water! 

Then use carbon-coated electrodes on the PCB. Check whether metal oxidation is eliminated.

#### Worked! Next:
- carbon-coated: Since the carbon paste can dissolve in the ionic liquid, a carbon block is used instead.

##### Testing Carbon Block Electrodes
Place two opposing carbon block electrodes into the setup.Drop the assembly into a flask and immerse in HMIM-TFSI. Perform the sweep and observe the behavior of the carbon block electrodes. Record any current peaks.

#####  Replacing Carbon Paste with Carbon Block in Original Setup
Replace the carbon paste electrodes on the PCB with carbon block electrodes. Use a small amount of carbon paste to fix the carbon blocks in place, ensuring that this paste does not contact the ionic liquid.


## Measuring reaction-less ionic conductivity

We assemble our own conduction cells with separator, washers, and ionic liquid.

Conducted HMIM-TFSI ionic conductivity tests with 10kHz 1Vrms LCR meter, Display A set to resistance. Compare with literature: 0.07 S/m at RT.

| 35µm polymer with 8mm, 12mm diameters oval hole sandwiched between 1.6cm diameter washers and wet with IL | 12.79          | 0.017                     |


### Comparison with literature

[One of the HMIM-TFSI round robin studies](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/je7003484) report **0.077 S/m** with 10kHz 1Vrms LCR meter. The ionic conductivity we measured is 4x lower.

[HMIMTFSI | Celgard membrane](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adfm.202306633) reports **0.05 S/m** at RT with the following set-up:
- eis 10 kHz to 1 MHz; voltage amplitude of 10 mV
- HMIM-TFSI soaked in Celgard 2320 separator (polypropylene/polyethylene/polypropylene [PP/PE/PP] trilayer, 20 µm in thickness)

The ionic conductivity we measured is 5x lower, attributable to two causes.

Since the EIS signature of IL-soaked membrane resembles a CPE and resistor in series, measurements at higher $\omega$ would give lower readings of $Z'$. This makes a 1.5x difference.

![](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/889a831d-bec4-4036-b64b-d5845e0fc710/adfm202306633-fig-0006-m.png)


Difference in membranes: higher porosity increases ionic conductivity (same ref as above).
- [ ] what is our celgard model?


### Conclusion

What we measure in EIS and in the LCR meter is a mixture of the ionic conductivity and the electrolytic conductivity.   

Eg. [Round-robin study](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1351/PAC-REP-08-09-22/html?_llca=transfer%3A7772f5cf4e88d21caa9740949ee6e50d&_llch=be54cf61ae786d68bd48b5cc5bc50f30fd1c69baf8f171dbff7ac4594b409b46) showed us a conductivity that increases as a function of water content due to hydrolysis. [Ref 4](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/je700329a) measured this with the real intercept of EIS, which is the same thing i32a did to report ionic conductivity.

## LiTaO3 gating
We will perform the complete gating experiment on LiTaO3. 

!!! Order new PCBs !!!
- [x] 10h : Obtain LiTaO3 from box
- [ ]  : prepare new lithium IL
- [x] 11h : wire to PCB
- [x] 11h30 : perform EIS
- [ ] 12h : gate with graphite electrode


    

## PCB assembly
This is an experimental thing all of us need to do. 
1. Solder header pins onto PCB.
2. Attach sample to PCB with two painted electrodes.




## XRD 

### Domains: La2/3TiO3 & 
A cross-polarizer viewer was made. 
Streak patterns were visible on STO substrate, suggesting stress/domains.

Could we use a kind of full film XRD to observe domains and support "streaks" observed on STO through crossed polarizers?

When fresh La2/3 comes out, we have to try both too.


### Structural change: gated LiTaO3
Ionic conductivity was induced.


## Things for fresh films
- ipa rinse, XRD before after
- microscope cross polarizer
