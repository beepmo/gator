## Overview

Our timetable is what we have planned. 
Our [github](https://github.com/beepmo/gator
) records what we actually did.


This week we're full swing in the lab. Wed, Thurs, Fri: expect to be able to pack one-two lab sessions everyday.

## Presentation


We'd like to present a fundamental understanding of a redox reaction and welcome questions from everyone.

1. Person A: What does the voltage on the standard table of redox potentials mean?
    - [x] create annotated image

2. Person B: $V$ vs $x$ graphs: from vacuum to ionic liquid. 
    - [x] create drawings!

3. Person A: Voltage on the standard table refers to potential drop across the capacitor formed by the electric double layer.
    - [**EDL reference**](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3293/3/4/52)

Additional details: be prepared to speak on these during Q&A.
- We can get a rough $V$ vs $x$ graph from a reference electrode.
    - [x] include drawing with reference electrode
- Reactions happen always in pairs: reduction and oxidation. Thus, you have to add both reactions to determine the total voltage required.
- We can present data on the hydrolysis of pure water.
    - [ ] annotate data notebook
