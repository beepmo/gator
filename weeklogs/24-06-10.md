## Presentation


We'd like to present a fundamental understanding of a redox reaction and welcome questions from everyone.

Joan can also explain creation of the redox tables via cyclic voltammetry (bumps in IV curves).



## Lithium electrode fabrication



#### Commercial LMN electrode
Gift from Bahar: https://www.mtixtl.com/Li-IonBatteryCathode-bc-af-241mn-ds.aspx

- [x] check specs & reactions

## Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy

Aim to give Brian a tutorial.

#### [Learning EIS, prescribed by Clemence](https://lithiuminventory.com/experimental-electrochemistry/eis/)

Read : **Principles of EIS.** Get familiar with the basic concepts of EIS.

**RC circuits.** An introduction to equivalent circuit models and their simplest building blocks.

**Multiple time constants**. Building larger circuit models and understanding how elements combine.

**Constant phase elements.** An important circuit element for modelling non-ideal behaviour.



**Diffusion impedance.** Circuit elements for modelling mass transport in electrochemical systems.=> This one is not necessary but it may help understand our device better

**Fitting with real data.** A walkthrough of a practical data fitting process.


## Detecting water electrolysis in ionic liquid 

- [x] **Go through cyclic voltammetry with Joan.**

We still have a lot to learn from round-robin studies of HMIM-TFSI:
- [Part 1: experimental methods and results](https://www.nist.gov/publications/thermodynamic-and-thermophysical-properties-reference-ionic-liquid-1-hexyl-3)
    - track changes in $w(H_2O)$ throughout various experiments
- [Part 2: critical evaluation](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1351/PAC-REP-08-09-22/html?_llca=transfer%3A7772f5cf4e88d21caa9740949ee6e50d&_llch=be54cf61ae786d68bd48b5cc5bc50f30fd1c69baf8f171dbff7ac4594b409b46)
    - note results on electrolytic conductivity vs water mole fraction
    - pursue references on the measurement of electrolytic conductivity: how were the experiments set up?


#### Two experiments
Set sweep on Keithley: Linear dual sweep, start 0V, stop 2V, 200 points per cycle, 1 cycle.

Drop PCB in tall flask and immerse in HMIM-TFSI up to src-drn contact pads. First use exposed PCB electrodes as-is. Expect a peak in current at copper (0.34V) or aluminium (-1.66V): this would tell us the composition of the pads. Maybe we'll see a peak around 1.23V due to water! 

Then use carbon-coated electrodes on the PCB. Check whether metal oxidation is eliminated.

#### Worked! Next:
- carbon-coated: Since the carbon paste can dissolve in the ionic liquid, a carbon block is used instead.

##### Testing Carbon Block Electrodes
Place two opposing carbon block electrodes into the setup.Drop the assembly into a flask and immerse in HMIM-TFSI. Perform the sweep and observe the behavior of the carbon block electrodes. Record any current peaks.

#####  Replacing Carbon Paste with Carbon Block in Original Setup
Replace the carbon paste electrodes on the PCB with carbon block electrodes. Use a small amount of carbon paste to fix the carbon blocks in place, ensuring that this paste does not contact the ionic liquid.


## Measuring reaction-less ionic conductivity

We assemble our own conduction cells with separator, washers, and ionic liquid.

Conducted HMIM-TFSI ionic conductivity tests with 10kHz 1Vrms LCR meter, Display A set to resistance. Compare with literature: 0.07 S/m at RT.

| test description                                                                                          | resistance (Ω) | conductivity (S/m)        |

| 35µm polymer sandwiched between 1.6cm diameter washers and wet with IL                                    | 71.66          | 0.0024                    |

### Comparison with literature

[One of the HMIM-TFSI round robin studies](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/je7003484) report **0.077 S/m** with 10kHz 1Vrms LCR meter. The ionic conductivity we measured is 4x lower.

[HMIMTFSI | Celgard membrane](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adfm.202306633) reports **0.05 S/m** at RT with the following set-up:
- eis 10 kHz to 1 MHz; voltage amplitude of 10 mV
- HMIM-TFSI soaked in Celgard 2320 separator (polypropylene/polyethylene/polypropylene [PP/PE/PP] trilayer, 20 µm in thickness)

The ionic conductivity we measured is 5x lower, attributable to two causes.

Since the EIS signature of IL-soaked membrane resembles a CPE and resistor in series, measurements at higher $\omega$ would give lower readings of $Z'$. This makes a 1.5x difference.

Difference in membranes: higher porosity increases ionic conductivity (same ref as above).
- [ ] what is our celgard model?


### Conclusion

What we measure in EIS and in the LCR meter is a mixture of the ionic conductivity and the electrolytic conductivity.   

Eg. [Round-robin study](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1351/PAC-REP-08-09-22/html?_llca=transfer%3A7772f5cf4e88d21caa9740949ee6e50d&_llch=be54cf61ae786d68bd48b5cc5bc50f30fd1c69baf8f171dbff7ac4594b409b46) showed us a conductivity that increases as a function of water content due to hydrolysis. [Ref 4](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/je700329a) measured this with the real intercept of EIS, which is the same thing i32a did to report ionic conductivity.

## LiTaO3 gating
We will perform the complete gating experiment on LiTaO3.

Device assembly: while we're at it, let's produce two copies of the device.
- `1h` PCB assembly
- `1h` 1M LiTFSI || HMIM-TFSI preparation
    - 0.4105109489 mL ionic liquid vol
    - 117.8535883 mg LiTFSI salt mass
- `30min` Stacking commercial li material, separator, substrate; with ionic liquid. 
- `1h` Paint electrical connection from li gate to PCB spot

We divide device operation into two regimes, electrostatic and electrolysis, to the best of our knowledge. Perform all combinations of the following decision tree:
- Gate sign
- Gate magnitude: 1, 3
- Gate pulse period: 10s, 100s, 1000s. Always use 10% duty cycle.
Device operation:
1. Measure open circuit voltage.
2. Apply gate pulses **with respect to open circuit voltage**. 
This takes 12 experiments. Make sure to save data from each experiment and plot it immediately.

Changes to add to our experiemnt : 
1. Change the carbon paste that dissolves with IL with silver paste (polymer solvent instead of water)
2. Limit the area of the separator, a square smaller than the crystal (put it on the crystal, without any form of glue)
3. Tape the PCB down directly 
4. An even smaller square for the gate electrode, except on the 
5. Put some copper tape around the PCB to the gate 

## PCB assembly
This is an experimental thing all of us need to do. 
1. Solder header pins onto PCB.
2. Attach sample to PCB with two painted electrodes.



## Miscellaneous

- [x] Inspect substrates
- [x] discuss growth w Bruce
- [x] contract Brian

## XRD 
Could we use a kind of full film XRD to observe domains and support "streaks" observed on STO through crossed polarizers?
