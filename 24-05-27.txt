## Overview

Our timetable is what we have planned. 
Our [github](https://github.com/beepmo/gator
) records what we actually did.

This week, we prepare for two milestones:
- presenting at the MBE group meeting on Tuesday
- initiating experiments towards both tickets as soon as chemicals arrive â€” by Friday, subject to catastrophe.

## Presentation


We'd like to present a fundamental understanding of a redox reaction and welcome questions from everyone.

1. Person A: What does the voltage on the standard table of redox potentials mean?
    - [x] create annotated image

2. Person B: $V$ vs $x$ graphs: from vacuum to ionic liquid. 
    - [x] create drawings!

3. Person A: Voltage on the standard table refers to potential drop across the capacitor formed by the electric double layer.
    - [**EDL reference**](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3293/3/4/52)

Additional details: be prepared to speak on these during Q&A.
- We can get a rough $V$ vs $x$ graph from a reference electrode.
    - [x] include drawing with reference electrode
- Reactions happen always in pairs: reduction and oxidation. Thus, you have to add both reactions to determine the total voltage required.
- We can present data on the hydrolysis of pure water.
    - [ ] annotate data notebook


## Ticket foci

### Lithium electrode fabrication

Experiment planning:
- [ ] meet the ingredients
    - [ ] review MSDS for all chemicals
    - [ ] [binder review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473138/) & any relevant articles: What is the highest acceptable water proportion in initial slurry?
  
- [ ] calculate quantities 
- [ ] meet the equipment
- [ ] big step: write procedures

##### Commercial LMN electrode
Gift from Bahar: https://www.mtixtl.com/Li-IonBatteryCathode-bc-af-241mn-ds.aspx

- [ ] check specs & reactions

### Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
- [ ] Read this [article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/epdf/10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00070) on the subject 
- [ ] 


### Detecting water electrolysis in ionic liquid 

- [x] Complete Yibing online safety training!

Experiment planning:
- meet the HMIM-TFSI ionic liquid
    - [ ] review MSDS (no pH data available T^T)
    - [ ] review [Karl Fischer titration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Fischer_titration): how do people determine water content?
    - [ ] in round-robin studies of HMIM-TFSI:
        - [Part 1: experimental methods and results](https://www.nist.gov/publications/thermodynamic-and-thermophysical-properties-reference-ionic-liquid-1-hexyl-3)
            - track changes in $w(H_2O)$ throughout various experiments
        - [Part 2: critical evaluation](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1351/PAC-REP-08-09-22/html?_llca=transfer%3A7772f5cf4e88d21caa9740949ee6e50d&_llch=be54cf61ae786d68bd48b5cc5bc50f30fd1c69baf8f171dbff7ac4594b409b46)
            - note results on electrolytic conductivity vs water mole fraction
            - pursue references on the measurement of electrolytic conductivity: how were the experiments set up?

- dry run: build the electrode set-up. Choose freely from any available electrode/glassware. Apply voltage scan with the Keithley in a liquidless set-up.



Data analysis:
- Compare with deionized water control test.


### Miscellaneous
- [x] pick up polymer separator from Bahar
- [x] order PCB components
    - [x] visit LSK basement
- [ ] Inspect substrates


Next ideas : 
- [ ] in situ XRD (while we do the gating)
- [ ] XRD at the end if we don't maange the 1st one 
- [ ] ionic conductivity withe EIS
